# AI Research & Development

My Personal repository focused on rigorous, mathematically grounded implementations of LLMs, VLMs, and World Models -- bypassing high-level abstractions in favor of first-principles understanding, this personal learning serves as my foundations for the R&D Projects I carry out at NAMETA Labs.

### 3. AI Physiotherapy Trainer · [repo](https://github.com/MuhammadZakiAhmad/AITrainer-CV-Application-)
Real-time pose estimation for patient exercise monitoring. Detects and tracks human poses to count repetitions and provide live feedback during physiotherapy sessions.
`OpenCV · Mediapipe`

### 4. Smart Car Detection & Counting · [repo](https://github.com/MuhammadZakiAhmad/cvProject2_carCounterUsingYOLOv8)
Defines a Region of Interest for vehicle counting, applies object tracking, and visualizes counts in real-time using YOLOv8.
`YOLOv8 · OpenCV`

### 5. Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) · [repo](https://github.com/MuhammadZakiAhmad/ANPRUsingYOLOv8)
Detects vehicles, localizes license plates, reads plate numbers via OCR, and logs the data. Combines detection, tracking, and text recognition in a single pipeline.
`YOLOv8 · EasyOCR · SORT · OpenCV`

### 6. Human Emotion Detection · [repo](https://github.com/MuhammadZakiAhmad/HumanEmotionDetection)
Image classifier trained from scratch on FER-2013 (48×48 grayscale faces) to recognize 7 emotions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral.
`TensorFlow · Keras · NumPy · Pandas · Matplotlib`

### 7. Chest Cancer Classification (MLflow + DVC) · [repo](https://github.com/MuhammadZakiAhmad/EndToEndChestCancerClassificationUsingMlflowAndDVC)
End-to-end ML pipeline for chest cancer classification from images, with a user-facing upload interface. Covers the full production lifecycle: experiment tracking, data versioning, and cloud deployment.
